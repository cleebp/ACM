# ACM

Edit me to add ideas for improving ACM.

## To do

- Establish a meeting time.
- Discuss new officer positions, establish firm set of minimum responsibilities for each. Fenwick needs to be involved in this process.
- Flesh out benefits of being a member, on both the national- and chapter levels. If we continue not having members, we aren't really a club.
- Talk to Dr Coffey about working with the Hardin Park Elementary [CS Club](http://craig-marze-d.wataugasd.hpes.schoolfusion.us/modules/groups/integrated_home.phtml?gid=4376789).
