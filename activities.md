# Activities

If there are any activities you think would be worth doing at an ACM meeting, add them to this list.

## Weekly Update

We should devote <= 5 minutes at the beginning of each meeting to talk about interesting stuff we saw the previous week related to CS or programming.

## [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

We should hack on problems from Project Euler in order to learn new languages or programming techniques. We could work on teams and compete to see which teams can solve the most problems. (Alternatively, we could use different criteria, e.g. most different languages used, fastest implementations, code golf)

## Workshops

Following talks, we could have hour-long workshops in which people put the ideas to which they were just exposed to use. Alternatively, we could have them do exercises during the talks, with the presenter leading a pseudo-class/lab.
