# Talks

If there are any topics you would be willing to talk about, add your name and talks to this list.

## Jon Johnson

- My experience at IBM
- Node
- Cloud PaaS stuff
- Git/GitHub
- Basics of Vim
- Licensing Issues

## Gabriel Triggs
- Haskell (and FP in general - functions as first-class citizens, referential transparency, higher-order functions, etc.)
- The Lambda Calculus
- I'd like to give the above two at an AppHack, back-to-back, doing probably half an hour about the lamda calculus and then maybe a whole hour about FP (using Haskell as my example language.)
- NP-Completeness (Halting Problem, Acceptance Problem, possibly others)
- Combinatoric play (Is the set of Rick-and-Morty-themed puns finite or countably or uncountably infinite?)

## Jon and Gabriel
- Perhaps we could give a co-talk on the functional features of Java 8? If you aren't interested in doing it together, I can give the talk solo.

## Alek Ratzloff
- C++ (specifically metaprogramming with templates)

## People to ask to speak
- Clint Guin / Tim Jassmann - DIP and machine learning
- Clint Guin - the game dev process
- David Kale - graphics
- Patricia Johann - functional programming, type (and category) theory
- Shay Cichocki - web development, life after undergrad CS

## Campus organizations that might be worth hearing from
- AITP - maybe let them send an officer to talk to us about why we might want to join
- Red Flag - organization gives hour-long talks about sexual abuse and how to stop it - not a message we really hear a lot of in CAP, but I think they have some important things to say. I'd like to get input on this one.
