# Social Activities

I know the concept of doing social things in the context of ACM may seem strange (at least, it did to me initially), but one of the functions of clubs on campus is to provide a social meeting space for people of shared interest (if anybody has been exposed to Math club, you know what I mean).

If there are any activities you'd be interested in, add them to this list.

- Movie nights at Greer
- LAN parties (or whatever the hell the modern equivalent is - maybe a tournament?)
- Late-night programming hangouts held at rotating locations (members' apartments, local restaurants, library, etc.)
- Bowling? Do people bowl?
- Bo's in Lenoir (I think it's like a 40-minute drive) has group discount rates
- A 21-and-over night at AMB
- A brewery tour at AMB - it's $10/person - maybe ACM could subsidize this for members
